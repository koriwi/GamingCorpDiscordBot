##This is a learning project!##

You have to create a credentials.json:

```
{
	"email": "abc@cde.fg",
	"pw": "xXxXxX",
	"serverid":"123456789123456789"
}
```

##Discord.js##
We are using the newest version from github right now.(npm not up to date with what we need)
https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js
That means we have to grunt it ourselfs. Thats easy.
1) npm install -g grunt-cli
2) npm install grunt
3) cd ./node_modules/discord.js
4) grunt
5) done!

###I get an error when i want to play youtube!###
You have to make sure that every node-module uses ytdl-core 0.7.7 at least.
